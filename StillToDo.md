# Still To Do (Project & Release Scope)

## Release Readiness
- **Gameplay balancing pass:** Validate stamina, balance shock, and weapon damage curves across multiple encounter profiles.
- **Input/controls polish:** Confirm keybindings, sprint toggles, and controller mapping (if planned) are finalized and documented.
- **Accessibility review:** Ensure HUD contrast, text sizing, and color choices meet accessibility goals.

## Visual & Gameplay Follow-ups
- **Viewport tuning across devices:** Validate camera focus/zoom on ultrawide and small viewports.
- **Attack readability checks:** Verify weapon reach scaling remains aligned with hit logic as new weapon types and swing poses are added.
- **Animation feedback:** Add or refine effects for hits, blocks, and stamina exhaustion states.

## Testing & Quality
- **Maintain high coverage:** Continue expanding tests as new branches and systems are introduced.
- **Visual regression checks:** Add baseline screenshots once a stable UI snapshot pipeline is established.
- **Performance profiling:** Measure simulation and rendering performance for target devices before release.

## Documentation & Release Artifacts
- **Gameplay presentation notes:** Document camera assumptions and weapon reach visualization behavior.
- **Release checklist:** Create a versioned checklist covering build, test, and deployment steps.
- **Player guide updates:** Ensure HOWTO/WELCOME docs reflect finalized mechanics and controls.
