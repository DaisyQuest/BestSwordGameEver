# Welcome to Best Sword Game Ever

Best Sword Game Ever is a physics-driven, browser-based combat game. The project blends deterministic simulation, responsive input, and stylized combat visuals to deliver a fast, readable duel experience.

## Project Goals

- **Responsive combat:** Every swing, hit, and movement should feel immediate and predictable.
- **Readable encounters:** Animation cues, weapon reach, and stamina feedback must be clear to players.
- **Release-ready polish:** The demo experience should be stable, accessible, and easy to launch.

## Getting Started

- Run the demo locally using the instructions in `HOWTO_PLAY.md`.
- Review `OverallProgressReport.md` and `StillToDo.md` for project status and release readiness tasks.
